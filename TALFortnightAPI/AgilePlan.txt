Pseudo Cards for my TAL Fortnight API Sprint
Difficult Ratings Very Rough and from 2-5 in line with fibonacci - inital ratings based off of 'feel' and 
what is known / unknown with unkowns ranked as more complex
TBC = To Be Completed

Goal -> outlined by scott

Cards -> 

How to call an API
-> Determine how to pass a get command to an API [DONE] (2)
-> Determine how to pass a post command to an API [DONE] (2)
-> Spike (Research / pick either / or utilize both synchronous and asynchronous development) [IN PROGRESS] (3)
-> Spike (Research how to pass headers and parameters to APIs) [CONTINUOUS] (3)


How to create a front end
-> Spike (Research different local web hosts e.g. blazor or asp.net core web app and potentially asure) [TBC] (3) 
-> Create a very basic front end on selected front end solution type [TBC] (3)
-> Spike (Research different ways to program this e.g. c# potentially? java through react / angular?) [TBC] (3)

How to create an API
-> Spike (Research what is or isn't involved in creating an API - break down into further cards) [TBC] (5)
-> If previous spike yields viable, create an API as determined in previous spike [TBC] (3)


First Iteration Project (someone else's api and base line functionality) - Iteration 1.0
-> Spike (Research APIs and determine base line functionality in case of blockers & to allow for scalability in iteration 2 if time) [TBC] (2)
-> Spike (Research chosen API / APIs and determine specific functionality to implement and make specific criteria for iteration 1) [TBC] (2)
-> Develop code to call existing API and make queriable [TBC] (5)
-> Develop front end and ensure working first iteration in conjunction with back end code [TBC] (5)   

// 31/1/23 - Everything from here down seems untimely so unless circumstances change later only the above will be completed

Iteration 1.1
-> If viable ammend Iteration 1.0 to involve my own API that I need to create and then merge to the existing solution [TBC] (5)

Second Iteration Project
... come back to in few days -> expand functionality or if my own API wasn't included originally and Iteration 1.1 was scrapped
consider implementing here if viable [TBC] (5)


Intention - Show my work to a few people on Wednesday in order to get feedback for 2nd week - not showing this plan initially because I think
I've learnt a lot from watching and talking to everyone so I want to face the issues of this plan myself and reflect halfway through and after
completion.
