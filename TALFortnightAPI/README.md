# TALFortnightAPI
A two week project in which I develop a local website that can can and query and API to retrieve data.

The plan is to update this as stuff changes and I run into errors or learn / make progress (seperated by ----)

----------------------
Requirements: (Ver 1.0)

Front end - need to determine how to build (ui on a locally hosted website) (java?)

Api - determine which API to call and how to return data (c#) 


Initial build scope:

Use Case:
As a user
I want to enter my suburb and retrieve expected temperature data
So that I can plan a date with my girlfriend

Business Benefit: An Al with a happy girlfriend is a happy Al which is a productive Al
